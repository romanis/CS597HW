This is the zero homework submitted to check I can write C++ code and tex markdown. 
To compile please use any gcc compiler (on aci-b use e.g. module load gcc/5.3.1)
please compile with simple $make comand or $make all or $make hello
to run execute ./hello

The program should ask your name and grit you with hello, %name%
